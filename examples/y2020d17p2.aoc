conway of 4 dimensions and infinite size
  initial state at ./y2020d17.txt
  where '.' represents emptiness
  and   '#' means 'active'
  cells transition
    from active to active if (neighbors active) = 2 || (neighbors active) = 3
    from emptiness to active if (neighbors active) = 3
    otherwise a cell is emptiness

solution
  after_transitions 6
    | positions active
    | count
