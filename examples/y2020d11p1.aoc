conway of 2 dimensions
  initial state at ./y2020d11.txt
  where '.' means 'floor'
  and   'L' means 'empty'
  and   '#' means 'occupied'
  cells transition
    from empty to occupied if (neighbors occupied) = 0
    from occupied to empty if (neighbors occupied) >= 4
    otherwise a cell is unchanged
